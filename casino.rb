# Pretend we are a casino, and weâ€™ve hired you to design a library for us.
# This library will provide the functionality of a deck of playing cards, using any object-oriented language.
# It can be in Ruby or the language of your choice.
# We are not looking for a game or simulation, but just a library that another developer could use and reasonably trust.

# At a minimum, the library should be able to shuffle the deck of cards, deal a hand,
# and take back discarded cards from a hand. We would also like a developer to easily
# provide their own shuffle algorithm if your default one needs to change.
